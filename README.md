# AlgaT
Tutorial application on HeapTree and HeapSort by Enea Guidi, Marco Tomasone and Luca Genova.
AlgaT is a project to help newcomers understand data structures as HeapTree and the algorithm HeapSort

From the welcome screen you can chose between different option:
  1) Lessons: is a simple and short lessons on: HeapTree and it's implementation, and HeapSort that uses the HeapTree data structure to 
  sort something.
  2) Test: this part contains two kind of exercise, one on the HeapTree, instead the other part, as you can guess, is on HeapSort.
  3) The third, and most exiciting; part is a HeapTree and HeapSort simulator where you can see grafically how the things work really
  and hopefully understand better the concepts behind.

To start the application just compile the source code and enjoy, else you can directly run the.jar file on the JVM the AlgaT.jar can be found in AlgaT/productions/artifacts
Please report any problem or issue
