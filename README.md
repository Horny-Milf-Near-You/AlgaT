# AlgaT
Tutorial application on HeapTree and HeapSort by Enea Guidi, Marco Tomasone and Luca Genova.
AlgaT is a project to help newcomers understand data structures as HeapTree and the algorithm HeapSort

## Instructions
Once the program started from the welcome screen you can choose between three different options:
  * **Lessons**: is a simple and short explanation on the HeapTree data structures, its implementation and others things related to the data structures. The second lesson is related instead on the sorting algorithm HeapSort again with a brief explanation of how does it work and why it relies on the HeapTree data structure
  
  * **Simulator**: this part of the application let the user play with both the data structure and the sorting algorithm to visually understand how everything work, the user cna both skip all the step and see the final output of the operations or do a step-to-step progression
  
  * **Test**: is a part where the user can exercise his knowledge with simple question to make sure he understood all the basic concept of the lessons, the exercise are interactive and aim to strengthen the user understanding of the concepts above

## How-To
To start the application just compile the source code and enjoy, else you can directly run the.jar file on the JVM the AlgaT.jar can be found in AlgaT/productions/artifacts
